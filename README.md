## 🌀 Why I Built It

I built RoboSage to merge the technical and the emotional—something I rarely see in AI projects. I wanted a system that not only detects what’s happening in its environment but responds in a meaningful, human-aware way.

This project reflects my passion for AI, cybersecurity, psychology, and creativity. As someone who’s trained both physically and mentally at a high-performance level, I wanted to create a system that protects, understands, and guides—just like the mentors who shaped me.

RoboSage is more than a program. It’s a guardian, a mirror, and a tiny spark of consciousness.
